# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the AoC 2023 challenges. I mostly use these as an opportunity to learn Rust, so, while I'd generally say the code is up to the task, the choice of language features might not be the best for the use case and I usually don't refactor this code once it ran successfully and acceptably fast.

Contains spoilers in the form of an `assert_eq!` at the end of each day.

Run without parameters to run the last day, run with `--all` to run all days in order.
